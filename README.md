# Tokenized Debt Management

## Project Title
Tokenized Debt Management

## Project Description
The **Tokenized Debt Management** project introduces a decentralized approach to managing debt obligations using blockchain technology. By creating a system where debts are tokenized, the contract allows both creditors and debtors to track and settle debts in a transparent and efficient manner. Payments can be made using cryptocurrency or tokens, facilitating easy and secure transactions.

The contract supports the creation of debts between debtors and creditors, allowing for debt repayments and token transfers. It also ensures that debts are not overpaid, offering features to view, pay off, and track the status of debt obligations.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to provide a decentralized and secure platform for managing debt transactions. It aims to simplify the process of creating, tracking, and paying debts without intermediaries. The platform will be easily accessible, transparent, and secure, leveraging blockchain technology to ensure trust and immutability in financial transactions.

## Key Features

- **Debt Creation**: Allows creditors to create debt obligations for debtors, including debt amount, due date, and the creditor's address.
- **Debt Payment**: Debtors can repay debts using cryptocurrency or tokens, ensuring accurate payments.
- **Token Transfers**: Users can transfer tokens to pay debts or settle transactions between parties.
- **Debt Tracking**: Provides functionality to track and view the details of all debts associated with a debtor.
- **Minting Tokens**: Allows administrators to mint new tokens and allocate them to users to facilitate transactions.

## Future Scope

- **Interest & Penalty Mechanism**: Integrating interest calculation and penalty fees for overdue debts.
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Adding support for different cryptocurrencies and stablecoins for debt repayments.
- **Reputation System**: Implementing a reputation score for both creditors and debtors to establish trustworthiness on the platform.
- **Decentralized Oracle Integration**: Integrating external oracles to fetch real-time data, such as exchange rates and market conditions, to calculate interest or penalties dynamically.
- **Debt Negotiation Features**: Adding functionality to negotiate terms or renegotiate debts between the creditor and debtor directly on-chain.
- **Cross-Chain Functionality**: Enabling the platform to interact with multiple blockchains, allowing users to settle debts across different networks.
